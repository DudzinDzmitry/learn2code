            Almost heaven, West Virginia <br />
            Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River <br />
            Life is old there, older than the trees <br />
            Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze <br />
            Country roads, take me home <br />
            To the place I belong <br />
            West Virginia, mountain mama <br />
            Take me home, country roads <br />
            All my memories gather 'round her <br />
            Miner's lady, stranger to blue water <br />
            Dark and dusty, painted on the sky <br />
            Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye <br />
            Country roads, take me home <br />
            To the place I belong <br />
            West Virginia, mountain mama <br />
            Take me home, country roads <br />
            I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me <br />
            The radio reminds me of my home far away <br />
            Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin' <br />
            That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday <br />
            Country roads, take me home <br />
            To the place I belong <br />
            West Virginia, mountain mama <br />
            Take me home, country roads <br />
            Country roads, take me home <br />
            To the place I belong <br />
            West Virginia, mountain mama <br />
            Take me home, country roads <br />
            Take me home, (down) country roads <br />
            Take me home, (down) country roads <br />
        </div>
